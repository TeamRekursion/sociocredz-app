    <h5 align = "center"> Have you ever wanted to do something for the social cause but lacked the time and the means to do it? <br>Don’t worry SocioCredz is here to help you. SocioCredz will help you to provide education, and food, etc<br> to the people in need without you even spending a single penny from your pocket!

### What is the idea?
We often go to stores in the mall and after purchasing things, most of the time we link our <br> mobile
number with the company, and according to the shopping amount certain points are <br>added to our number which can be redeemed whenever a user wants. 

We aim to tie up with these companies so that instead of adding these points to the user’s <br>company account, the user can choose to add these points to our app ‘SocioCredz’. Now, what<br> can the users do with these credits? 

We offer various services such as distributing food, providing books, and proper sanitation to <br>the needy. Suppose distributing food costs 100 credits, the user can use his/her available<br> credits to select this service.

Now you might wonder how will the food, books, etc actually be distributed to the people in <br> need. We aim to tie up with NGOs for this purpose. We have made a frontend portal for the <br>NGOs to register themselves with us. The services selected by the user will be directed to the<br> NGOs that have the least number of requests so that there is no delay of service to the<br> people in need.  The NGOs can even start a campaign on our app to raise funds.

Lastly, how can the user trust us that service is delivered to those in need? Once the service is<br> completed by a representative of the NGO, he/she will upload a video on the portal which will<br> be visible to the user on the application as well.
